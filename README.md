# DRAW-Tensorflow

**Work in Progress**

This is a tensorflow implementation of DRAW model from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623.pdf

First we implemented a basic Variational Autoencoder to understand basic models Autoencoder models and after that, we have also implemented the Google's DRAW model for generating images, both with attention and without attention.
